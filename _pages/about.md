I am a Young Investigator (Tenure-Track Associate Professor) at [Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences (SCMS), Fudan University](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn/) (since September 2022).

Before joining SCMS, I was an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics at Texas A&M University](https://stat.tamu.edu/) (09/2019--08/2022). 

My research interest is on the interface of applied probability and statistics, especially the modeling of heavy-tailed phenomena in complex networks.

I received my Ph.D. in Operations Research from the [School of Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University](https://www.orie.cornell.edu) in August 2019, under the supervision of Prof. Sidney Resnick.
